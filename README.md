# Data-Binding-Demo_app
Data Binding Library is a Jetpack suport library that allow you to bind UI components in your layout to data sources in your app using declarative format rather than programatically.
Basically, it avoid the usage of ***findViewById()*** to assign object to the views with the given ID().
Instead we use ***Binding Object*** that contains a reference to each view of a layout, so the android system will not go & search the views by their Ids again n again.
